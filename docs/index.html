    <h1>My Meeting with Three Giants</h1>
    <p>One loud night , I set out on a walk — and met three giants who changed the way I see the world.</p>

    <h2>The First Giant</h2>

    <p>He spoke slowly, like stone grinding on stone, and asked me what I was building. I said <span>“websites.”</span>
      He laughed —
      the kind of laugh that shakes trees.</p>

    <h2>The Second Giant</h2>

    <p>This one didn’t speak at all. He just looked at me, and in that silence I realized how loud my thoughts were.</p>

    <p>He gave me no advice. Only a nod, as if to say: keep going. The path is yours now.</p>
